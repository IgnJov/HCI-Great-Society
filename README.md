# HCI-Great-Society

**Description**

Great Society is an idea about a community engaged in humanity. The community acts as a forum for the community to develop themselves and help others in need. There are two main programs run by Great Society, the first is volunteering which provides opportunities for the community to take part in social movements such as education through learning videos and live teaching and other real social actions. The second program is donations, this program provides an opportunity for everyone to make donations to fundraising for humanitarian causes.

Great Society has a website that functions as a portal for people who want to register as volunteers, access learning videos and make donations.

This website was created as the final project of the Human-Computer Interaction course. The design of the website is done through the Figma application and the work is done in groups through Visual Studio Code. The entire display is made using HTML and CSS.
